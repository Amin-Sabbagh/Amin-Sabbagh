A 3rd year Software Engineering student at Manchester Metropolitan University, currently doing a placement year, working towards a 1st class honours. Completed an internship within a Technology Consultancy, which has allowed me to develop my coding knowledge and have hands-on experience in a tech start-up organisation, as well as further developed transfer-able skills such as problem-solving, thinking outside the box, and communication. I am a hardworking, highly motivated team player, and a very quick learner, who is seeking to further my skill base in the world of digital and cloud engineering.
